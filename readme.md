> Requires C++17. Targets recent GCC, Clang, MSVC. Namespace `ltl::ntbs`

### Hello-world example: **`cat`**

```c++
 #include "ntbs.hpp"
 using ltl::ntbs;

 constexpr auto hello_world = cat(cat<',',' '>("Hello","world"),'!');

 static_assert( hello_world == "Hello, world!" );
```

### Hello-world example continued: **`cut`**

```c++
 constexpr auto hello_comma = cut<0,6>(hello_world);
 constexpr auto world_exclaim = cut<-7>(hello_world);

 #include <cstdio>
 int main() { puts( cat<' '>(hello_comma, world_exclaim) ); }
```

Outputs "**`Hello, world!`**", spliced back together from the sliced words.

Note that `cut` indices `B,E` are **signed** integers specifying range `[B,E)`:

>* Positive values index forward from begin index 0 as usual
>* Negative values index backward from the end of the char array

Here, -1 serves as end index (actually the null-terminator index for NTBS)  
so `cut<-7>(hello_world)` is equivalent to `cut<-7,-1>(hello_world)`

Results are returned in a **constexpr C string** type; a `char[N]` array wrapped in a class  
and understood to contain `N-1` characters followed by a terminating zero character.  
This class acts like a copyable / returnable `char[N]`, call it `Char<N>` (the actual type,  
`ltl::ntbs::array<N>`, is an implementation detail, not meant for direct use).

Generic access is provided by free-function 'size' and 'data' overloads:

* `size(Char<N>{})` returns `N`, the array size (including null terminator)  
* `data(a)` returns a `const char*` (or array ref) for the array `begin`  

`Char<N>` has implicit conversion to `const char(&)[N]`, decaying to `const char*`.

`operator==` and `!=` are provided for comparisons, up to full static size  
including the terminating character and any embedded null characters.

`ntbs::cmp` is a constexpr version of `strcmp` for lexicographic comparison.

### Design notes

**Constexpr std::string**, as proposed for C++2a, will likely replace many use cases.  
C++2a constexpr string splicing will also benefit from more constexpr algorithms.  
C++17 **std::string_view** is a good companion but constexpr size is lost in passing  
to a constexpr function.

* `ntbs` is not intended for run-time so compile-time is the appropriate metric
* Originally implemented with `index_sequence` then switched to looping  
(experimented with Clang 8 constexpr builtin memcpy but saw no benefit).
* Originally held non-null-terminated data, then switched to null termination -  
having a null terminator is convenient in more use cases.
* ntbs size is limited by the constexpr loop iteration count limit
* Compile times increase to seconds for cats  around 256K chars
* Run-time use cases are constrained by the need for static size,  
 for example 3-char currency-pair stitching "USD"+"CAD" = "USDCAD"
